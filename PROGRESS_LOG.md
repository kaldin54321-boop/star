# Star-Compose — Progress Log

## 2026-05-07 — Accent + visibility sweep (`fix/accent-and-visibility-sweep`)

**Branch:** `fix/accent-and-visibility-sweep` off `beta4`

**Bugs reported by user (with screenshots, accent set to lime green via Appearance picker):**
1. Magnifier in-game overlay: "100%" zoom percentage rendered black-on-dark; the three buttons (−, +, ✕) used a muted purple-gray that ignored the accent picker entirely.
2. CPU pinning checkboxes (Container Settings & Shortcut Settings → Advanced) stayed purple instead of following the user's lime accent.
3. Environment Variables row toggles (boolean envvars like MESA_SHADER_CACHE_DISABLE) rendered in default Android blue regardless of accent.
4. Graphics Engine (FSR) overlay still had labels rendering as dark text on dark surface — first attempted on `fix/cpu-pin-and-graphics-engine-visibility` (which the user confirmed worked but was never merged); folded into this sweep.

**Root causes:**
- Anything reading `MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primary` follows the accent picker correctly. But Compose `FilledTonalButton` reads `secondaryContainer` / `onSecondaryContainer`, which `ThemePreset.toColorScheme()` was not setting — so M3 fell back to its built-in default purple-gray, ignoring the user's choice. Magnifier buttons are the only `FilledTonalButton` usage in the codebase.
- Legacy XML widgets (`CPUListView`, `EnvVarsView`) inflate their CheckBox/ToggleButton from static `styles.xml` resources, which are baked at build time and never see the runtime `AppThemeState`. These widgets need to read the accent programmatically and apply it after inflation.
- FSROverlay and MagnifierOverlay use `Modifier.background(...)` rather than a `Surface { ... }`, which means `LocalContentColor` is never set, so Text composables without an explicit `color = ...` fall back to `Color.Black` even though the surrounding `WinlatorTheme` defines `onSurface` as light gray.

**Fixes:**
- `ThemePreset.kt` — `toColorScheme()` and `toLightColorScheme()` now also set `secondary`, `onSecondary`, `secondaryContainer`, `onSecondaryContainer` derived from the accent. The smallest surface change that fixes Magnifier `FilledTonalButton`s without affecting any other unaudited M3 widgets (verified: zero other `FilledTonalButton`/`FilledCard`/etc. in tree).
- `MagnifierOverlay.kt` — added `color = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.onSurface` to the "100%" Text.
- `FSROverlay.kt` — re-applied the four `color = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.onSurface` fixes from the abandoned `fix/cpu-pin-and-graphics-engine-visibility` branch (confirmed working by user testing).
- `AppThemeState.kt` — added `@JvmStatic fun getCurrentAccentArgb(): Int` so legacy Java widgets can read the current accent without doing Kotlin inline-class gymnastics from Java.
- `CPUListView.java` — after inflating each CPU CheckBox, calls `CompoundButtonCompat.setButtonTintList(...)` with a `ColorStateList` built from `AppThemeState.getCurrentAccentArgb()`. Defensive fallback to `#FFBA86FC` if the singleton is somehow not yet initialised.
- `EnvVarsView.java` — added `applyAccentTint(view)` helper that calls `setBackgroundTintList(...)` on legacy `ToggleButton` widgets in the boolean-envvar row. Wired into the existing `applyDarkTheme` path so the tint is applied alongside the dark-mode setup.

**Why the sweep was bundled:**
- The four root causes are entangled: Tier B (theme gap) is what makes Magnifier buttons pick up the accent; Tier C/D (legacy widget tinting) needs the same `getCurrentAccentArgb()` helper that has to be added to `AppThemeState`. Splitting would have required a private helper duplicated across two files.
- One CI run, one device test, one merge.

**Files touched:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/theme/ThemePreset.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/theme/AppThemeState.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/overlays/FSROverlay.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/overlays/MagnifierOverlay.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/widget/CPUListView.java`
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/widget/EnvVarsView.java`

**Pending follow-up:** The abandoned `fix/cpu-pin-and-graphics-engine-visibility` branch (commit `2b0a2a0`) should be deleted after this sweep merges, since its FSROverlay fix is replicated here and its bad XML hex tint was already reverted.

## 2026-05-07 — Shortcut Settings tab-switch state-loss fix (`fix/shortcut-envvars-tab-switch-loss`)

**Branch:** `fix/shortcut-envvars-tab-switch-loss` off `beta4`

**Bug reported by user:** Same tab-switch state-loss seen earlier in Container Settings was also reported in **Shortcut Settings** — editing a shortcut, adding an env var, switching tabs, then switching back: the var is gone.

**Root cause:** Identical pattern to the Container Settings fix from earlier today. `ScEnvVarsTab` and `ScAdvancedTab` in `ShortcutsScreen.kt` host legacy Java widgets (`EnvVarsView`, `CPUListView`) via `AndroidView`. Source of truth lives inside the widget; parent `save()` reads it through a `MutableState<View?>` ref. Tab switch destroys the Composable + widget, taking unsaved input with it. Fallback (`shortcut.getExtra(...)`) returns the stored extra, which was never updated during editing.

**Fix:**
- `ScEnvVarsTab` already receives `shortcut` — added `DisposableEffect(Unit) { onDispose { ... } }` that flushes `envVarsViewRef.value?.envVars` into `shortcut.putExtra("envVars", ...)` before disposal. `Shortcut.putExtra` mutates only the in-memory JSONObject; disk persistence still happens later via `save() → saveData()` so Cancel still discards correctly.
- `ScAdvancedTab` doesn't receive `shortcut` directly. Added an `onCpuListSnapshot: (String) -> Unit` parameter; the parent passes `{ shortcut.putExtra("cpuList", it) }`. DisposableEffect inside the tab calls the snapshot.
- Added explicit `import androidx.compose.runtime.DisposableEffect` (file uses explicit imports).

**Files touched:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/screens/ShortcutsScreen.kt`

## 2026-05-07 — Container Settings tab-switch state-loss fix (`fix/envvars-tab-switch-loss`)

**Branch:** `fix/envvars-tab-switch-loss` off `beta4`

**Bug reported by user:** In Container Settings, after adding Environment Variables, switching to the Drives tab loses all the edits. They only persist if OK is clicked while still on the Env Vars tab.

**Root cause:** `EnvVarsTab` and `AdvancedTab` (CPU pin lists) use legacy Java widgets (`EnvVarsView`, `CPUListView`) hosted via `AndroidView`. The widget's internal state is the source of truth, with the parent screen reading it on save through a `MutableState<View?>` ref. When the user leaves the tab, the Composable disposes, the AndroidView destroys the underlying Java widget, and the user's unsaved input dies with it. The save path's fallback (`viewModel.envVarsStr`) is stale because nothing ever writes to it during editing.

**Fix:** Add a `DisposableEffect(Unit)` to both `EnvVarsTab` and `AdvancedTab` that, on dispose, reads the current widget value through the ref and writes it back to the corresponding `var` on `ContainerDetailViewModel` (`envVarsStr`, `cpuList`, `cpuListWoW64`). The `var ... by mutableStateOf(...)` setters cause the next composition to seed the widget from the latest value, so a round-trip Drives → Env Vars now shows the user's edits intact.

**Files touched:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/screens/ContainerDetailScreen.kt` — added two `DisposableEffect` blocks (lines ~470, ~610)

**Long-term:** Replace `EnvVarsView` and `CPUListView` legacy widgets with native Compose components that two-way-bind the ViewModel directly (same pattern as `DrivesTab` already uses). Tracked under `project_star_compose_ui_cleanup.md` Java/XML→Compose migration.

## Feedback Fix Plan

Source: Developer feedback comparing v1.1 (old Java/XML) vs Compose version.  
8 issues identified. Listed in execution order (smallest/highest impact first).

---

### Job 1 — Help and Support (BROKEN)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — commit `93d0326`, CI run `24569312463`  
**File:** `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/AppDrawer.kt`  
**Problem:** `onClick = { /* TODO: open help URL or dialog */ }` — tapping does nothing  
**Fix:** Replace the TODO with a Compose `AlertDialog` containing:
- GitHub repo link: https://github.com/The412Banner/star-compose
- Issue tracker link
- A "Close" button
Or alternatively open a URL via `Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(url))`.  
**Effort:** 30 min  
**Commit message:** `fix: implement Help and Support dialog`

---

### Job 2 — About Dialog (MISSING CONTENT)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — commit `d18cae6`, CI run `24569669122`  
**File:** `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/MainActivity.kt` — `AboutDialog()` at bottom of file  
**Problem:** Current dialog is 4 lines of plain text. Missing: app icon/logo, version name, Wine/Box64/FEX versions, credits list.  
**Fix:** Rebuild `AboutDialog()` as a proper Compose `Dialog` (not AlertDialog — needs more space) with:
- App icon (R.mipmap.ic_launcher_foreground)
- App name + version (read from `BuildConfig.VERSION_NAME` + `BuildConfig.VERSION_CODE`)
- Powered-by section: Wine, Box64, FEX-Emu, Turnip
- Credits section with contributor names
- Close button  
**Effort:** 45 min  
**Commit message:** `feat: rebuild About dialog with logo, version, credits`

---

### Job 3 — Container Creation Loading Indicator
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — commit `2e5f4a1`, CI run `24570142005`  
**Files:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/screens/ContainerDetailScreen.kt` — Save button / confirm action
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/screens/ContainerDetailViewModel.kt` — `saveContainer()` or equivalent
**Problem:** When user taps Save on a new container, it creates silently with no progress feedback. On slow devices this looks like a freeze.  
**Fix:**
1. Add `isCreating: StateFlow<Boolean>` to `ContainerDetailViewModel`
2. Set it true before container creation starts, false when done
3. In `ContainerDetailScreen`, show a full-screen semi-transparent overlay with `CircularProgressIndicator` + "Creating container…" text when `isCreating == true`
4. Disable the Save button while creating  
**Effort:** 45 min  
**Commit message:** `feat: add loading overlay during container creation`

---

### Job 4 — Settings Theme Mismatch (Dark Mode Toggle Broken)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — commit `44a4bdb`, CI run `24571445525`  
**Files:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/theme/AppThemeState.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/theme/ThemePreset.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/theme/Theme.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/MainActivity.kt`
**Problem (two parts):**
1. `SettingsFragment` uses Light XML AppTheme while the rest of the app is dark Compose — mismatched look inside the Settings screen
2. The `dark_mode` SharedPreferences toggle in SettingsFragment has no effect on the Compose UI — `WinlatorTheme` always uses `darkColorScheme()`  
**Fix:**
1. Read `PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(this).getBoolean("dark_mode", false)` in `AppThemeState.init()` and store it as `isDarkMode: StateFlow<Boolean>`
2. Add a light variant to each `ThemePreset` (or use Material3 `lightColorScheme()` as the light base)
3. `AppThemeState.colorScheme` flow emits light or dark scheme based on `isDarkMode`
4. Register a `SharedPreferences.OnSharedPreferenceChangeListener` so toggling dark mode in Settings updates the flow in real time without restart
5. For SettingsFragment XML mismatch: set `android:theme="@style/Theme.AppCompat.DayNight"` on the fragment's parent or override the fragment background to match Compose surface color  
**Effort:** 1.5 hours  
**Commit message:** `fix: wire dark_mode preference to Compose theme + fix Settings appearance`

---

### Job 5 — Sort Shortcut List
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — commit `00dc6a5`, CI run `24571836336`  
**File:** `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/screens/ShortcutsScreen.kt`  
**Problem:** No sort option — shortcuts always appear in filesystem order  
**Fix:**
1. Add a sort icon button in the top bar or a sort dropdown in the shortcuts screen
2. Sort options: Name A→Z, Name Z→A, Last Played, Container
3. Store selected sort in `ShortcutsViewModel` (persisted to SharedPreferences)
4. Apply sort to the `shortcuts` StateFlow before emitting  
**Effort:** 1 hour  
**Commit message:** `feat: add sort options to shortcuts list`

---

### Job 6 — Import/Export Container
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — commit `8477b65`, CI run `24572308670`  
**Files:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/screens/ContainersScreen.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/winlator/cmod/ui/screens/ContainersViewModel.kt`
**Problem:** The old `ContainersFragment` had import/export container options. These are missing from the Compose version.  
**Fix:**
1. Add "Import Container" and "Export Container" options to the container long-press context menu (already has Duplicate/Delete)
2. Check original `ContainersFragment.java` (deleted) — refer to git history if needed, or find the logic in `ContainerManager.java`
3. Export: zip the container directory → write to Downloads or user-picked location via `ActivityResultContracts.CreateDocument`
4. Import: user picks a zip via `ActivityResultContracts.GetContent` → unzip to containers directory → reload list  
**Check ContainerManager.java for existing import/export methods first** — they likely already exist.  
**Effort:** 1.5 hours  
**Commit message:** `feat: add import/export container to containers screen`

---

### Job 7 — Add Shortcut from External Storage
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — commit `546d25e`, CI run `24577265773`  
**Files:** `ShortcutsViewModel.kt`, `ShortcutsScreen.kt`

---

### Job 8 — Shortcut List Layout Toggle (Grid / List)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — commit `546d25e`, CI run `24577265773`  
**Files:** `ShortcutsViewModel.kt`, `ShortcutsScreen.kt`

## VKD3D / DX12 Fix (2026-04-22→23) — MERGED TO MAIN ✅

**Branch:** `fix-vkd3d-content-profiles` → merged to main (`289609d`)
**CI Run:** `24835832785` (Manual Release Build, main)
**Verified:** D3D12 tests passing with content-profile VKD3D versions

### Root cause
The Compose migration broke VKD3D content-profile extraction in three ways:

1. **`loadVkd3dVersionList` identifier mismatch** — original code used `VKD3DVersionItem.getIdentifier()` which always produces `verName+"-"+verCode` (e.g. `"3.0b-0"`). The Compose migration changed this to omit verCode when 0, producing bare `"3.0b"`. This single-dash entry name crashed `getProfileByEntryName` via `substring(6,5)`, silently returning null.

2. **`getProfileByEntryName` crash on 2-part names** — fixed to handle both single-dash (verCode defaults to 0) and non-numeric verCode cases. Also gates match on install dir existing.

3. **Cache poisoned on failed extraction** — `extractDXWrapperFiles` was void; cache updated regardless of success, permanently locking the container. Changed to boolean; cache only updated on `return true`.

### Files changed
- `DXVKConfigDialog.java` — use `VKD3DVersionItem.getIdentifier()` in `loadVkd3dVersionList`
- `ContentsManager.java` — `getProfileByEntryName` single-dash + non-numeric verCode fix
- `XServerDisplayActivity.java` — `extractDXWrapperFiles` returns boolean; cache gated on success

---

## VKD3D / DX12 Debug Session (2026-04-22) — ROLLED BACK

**Restore point tag:** `pre-vkd3d-fixes` → commit `8485ac0`  
**Current main:** `8485ac0` (force-pushed back to restore point 2026-04-22)

### What was tried
A multi-session investigation into why D3D12 games fail with `E_NOINTERFACE` (0x80004002) in star-compose.

**Root causes identified:**
1. `ContentsManager.getProfileByEntryName` crashes on single-dash version strings like `"vkd3d-3.0b"` → `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException`, silently returns null
2. `extractDXWrapperFiles()` was `void` — cache updated even on failed extraction, poisoning containers permanently
3. Content server naming convention (`Vk3dk-arm64ec-3.0b`) doesn't match stored container configs (`3.0b`) — content-profile path never works for 3.0b
4. Built-in assets (2.8, 2.14.1) work fine; only content-profile / 3.0b versions were broken

**Fixes developed (all rolled back):**
- `getProfileByEntryName` single-dash + non-numeric verCode fix
- `extractDXWrapperFiles` → returns boolean; cache gated on success
- `DX_EXTRACT_VERSION` stamp to force cache bust across installs
- `VKD3DVersionItem` used in `loadVkd3dVersionList` for correct identifier format
- `vkd3d-3.0b.tzst` (4.8MB) bundled as asset alongside 2.8 and 2.14.1
- "3.0b" added to `vkd3d_version_entries` in arrays.xml

**Why rolled back:** User decision — returning to clean restore point to re-approach differently.

**Next session:** All the above fixes are documented and ready to re-apply. The bundled-asset approach (vkd3d-3.0b.tzst in assets/dxwrapper/) is the cleanest solution since content-server naming will never match container configs without a deeper refactor.

## Current Job (2026-04-22)

**Branch:** `compose-ingame-dialogs` → merged to main (`555eead`)  
**CI Run:** `24796752111` ✅ green (2026-04-22)

### In-game dialog migration (`compose-ingame-dialogs` branch)

**New files:**
- `ui/XServerDialogState.kt` — master bridge singleton (StateFlows + fun interface callbacks for all 8 dialogs + 2 overlays)
- `ui/XServerDialogHost.kt` — root composable + `setupDialogHost()` called from Activity; hosts all dialogs + overlays
- `ui/dialogs/VibrationDialog.kt` — multi-checkbox AlertDialog for controller vibration slots
- `ui/dialogs/DebugDialogContent.kt` — scrollable log viewer with Clear/Pause/Resume; LazyColumn auto-scrolls to bottom
- `ui/dialogs/InputControlsDialog.kt` — profile picker dropdown + 3 checkboxes + Profile Settings button
- `ui/dialogs/ScreenEffectsDialog.kt` — brightness/contrast/gamma sliders + shader checkboxes + profile add/remove
- `ui/dialogs/ActiveWindowsDialog.kt` — 2-column grid of windows with screenshot thumbnails (captured async with 100ms stagger)
- `ui/dialogs/TaskManagerDialog.kt` — process list with 1s refresh loop via LaunchedEffect; CPU + memory stats
- `ui/overlays/MagnifierOverlay.kt` — draggable floating panel with zoom +/- and hide button
- `ui/overlays/FSROverlay.kt` — draggable floating FSR/HDR control panel; live updates on every control change

**Activity changes (`XServerDisplayActivity.java`):**
- Removed: `DebugDialog`, `MagnifierView`, `TaskManagerDialog`, `ActiveWindowsDialog`, `ScreenEffectDialog`, `FSRControlFloatingDialog` direct instantiation
- Added: `XServerDialogHostKt.setupDialogHost()` call with full-size ComposeView in `FLXServerDisplay`
- All 8 drawer callbacks now populate `XServerDialogState` and call `show(ActiveDialog.XXX)`
- Debug log: `ProcessHelper.addDebugCallback(line -> dialogState.appendLog(line))` (no more DebugDialog instance)
- New private methods: `showScreenEffectsDialog()`, `showFsrOverlay()`, `showMagnifierOverlay()`, `showTaskManagerDialog()`, `findAppWindowsForCompose()`, `applyScreenEffects()`, `saveScreenEffectProfile()`, `updateTmCpuMemory()`

### In-game drawer migration (`compose-ingame-drawer` branch)
- `XServerDrawerState.kt` — singleton bridge (StateFlows + nullable callbacks) for Java↔Compose
- `XServerDrawer.kt` — full Compose drawer UI: all 15 menu items, collapsible Mouse & Cursor section with AnimatedVisibility, stateful pause/play icon, conditional Magnifier + Logs items
- `xserver_display_activity.xml` — `NavigationView` replaced with `ComposeView` (300dp, gravity=start)
- `XServerDisplayActivity.java` — removed `NavigationView`, all RecyclerView animation helpers (~400 lines), `onNavigationItemSelected`; added ComposeView + XServerDrawerState wiring

---

## AdrenoTools/Turnip Driver Fix (2026-04-20)

**Root cause:** The Compose migration moved `GPUInformation` JNI calls onto background coroutine threads (`Dispatchers.IO`). The AdrenoTools `hook_android_dlopen_ext` is not reentrant across threads — concurrent invocations from main + IO thread cause SIGSEGV.

**All `GPUInformation` native methods must run on the main thread:**
- `enumerateExtensions()` — moved to main thread via `LaunchedEffect(version)` (no `withContext`)
- `isDriverSupported()` / `getRenderer()` — moved to main thread in `LaunchedEffect(Unit)`, outside `withContext(Dispatchers.IO)`
- Pure file I/O (`enumarateInstalledDrivers()`, `gpu_cards.json`) stays on `Dispatchers.IO`

**File:** `ContainerDetailScreen.kt` → `GraphicsDriverConfigDialog` composable

## Controller Support — SDL2 SoName Symlink Fix (2026-05-06) — SHIPPED IN BETA 3 ✅

**Branch:** `fix/controller-support` → merged to `main` (PR #1, merge commit `7adfaf1`)
**Release:** [Winlator Star Bionic Compose Beta 3](https://github.com/The412Banner/star-compose/releases/tag/v7.1.4x-cmod-20260506-7adfaf1) — 2026-05-06
**CI:** Any-branch run `25456134263` ✅ green; Manual Release Build run `25456652846` ✅ green

### Root cause
Java→Compose splash-install migration introduced `SplashViewModel.installIfNeeded()` → `installFromAssetsWithCallback()` which is a copy-paste of the legacy `installFromAssets()` but lost the line that creates `<imagefs>/usr/lib/libSDL2-2.0.so.0` as a symlink to `libSDL2-2.0.so`. Wine xinput's `dlopen("libSDL2-2.0.so.0")` failed → fallback to winebus/HID stack → udev enumeration (broken on Android) → zero `/dev/input/event*` opens → libfakeinput hooks never fire → games saw no controller input.

Verification log: `star-controller-test-5.txt` (2026-05-06 15:09) shows `Adding controller fd 48 event event0..3`, `Hooking ioctl EVIOCGID/EV_KEY/EV_ABS/EV_FF`, `Assigned device 43 to slot 0`, `FakeInputWriter wrote slot=event0 bytes=48/48` then `72/72` — the full pipeline firing for the first time after the fix.

### Fix
Three commits cherry-picked clean from `controller-diag-combined` (which had diagnostic noise) onto `fix/controller-support`:
- `76c6628` — APK parity: `softRelease()` instead of `destroy()` on disconnect, releaseSlot keeps writers alive, pre-create event files, PlugPlay revert
- `81f1a9f` — pre-create all 4 event files at startup (Wine scans `/dev/input/` once at boot)
- `c48043f` — wire SDL2 SoName symlink into Compose splash install path; bump `LATEST_VERSION` 21→22 to force re-extract for existing users (Wine prefixes survive — `clearRootDir` preserves `home`)

Net diff: 5 files, +19/-5. Zero `InputDebug` references — all diagnostic code stripped.

### User verification
"yeah I could navigate in game menus and control the player fine" (gow.exe).

## Beta 3 Release Notes Pass (2026-05-06)

Renamed CI release to "**Winlator Star Bionic Compose Beta 3**" (matches Beta 2 naming). APK asset renamed via GH API to `Winlator-Star-Bionic-Compose-Beta3.apk`.

Release notes cover:
- Controller support root cause + 4 fixes
- Box64 component dropdown known limitation (cosmetic only — fix queued; later landed as Box64 fix below)
- Beta 2 → Beta 3 signing-key mismatch caveat (Android refuses install-on-top with sig mismatch; users must uninstall Beta 2 first, losing prefixes/containers)
- First-launch imagefs re-extract behavior (LATEST_VERSION 21→22) when signatures happen to match

## Box64 Dropdown — Stale-Display Bug Fix (2026-05-06) — ON BETA-4 ✅

**Branch:** `fix/box64-edit-dialog-stale-display` (commit `1330bb4`) → merged into `beta-4` (merge commit `fce8cf0`)
**CI:** Any-branch run `25459995549` ✅ green
**User verification:** "fixed and working correctly"

### Root cause
`ContainerDetailViewModel.loadContainerData()` calls `refreshWineDependent(selectedWineVersion)` which ends with:
```kotlin
selectedBox64Version = box64VersionEntries.firstOrNull() ?: ""  // resets to entry 0
```
Reset is correct on Wine-version change (Box64 entry list differs for arm64ec) but wrong on initial load — overrode the saved value before the dialog rendered. Save and runtime were always correct (DXVK HUD verified the chosen Box64 version was actually running); display-only bug.

### Fix
7 lines after `refreshWineDependent` call site at `ContainerDetailViewModel.kt:258`:
```kotlin
c?.box64Version
    ?.takeIf { it.isNotEmpty() && box64VersionEntries.contains(it) }
    ?.let { selectedBox64Version = it }
```
Mirrors the existing pattern used for FEXCore (`loadFEXCoreVersions()` then `selectedFEXCoreVersion = c?.getFEXCoreVersion()`).

## Branding/Version Rename (2026-05-06) — ON BETA-4 ✅

**Branch:** `feature/branding-rename-and-revamped-version` (commit `d7ee591`) → merged into `beta-4` (merge commit `6e89bd7`)
**CI:** run `25461593118` ✅ green
**User verification:** "all is changed correctly"

### Changes
4 user-facing strings updated in 4 files (+6/-6):

| File | Was | Now |
|---|---|---|
| `ui/screens/SplashScreen.kt` | "Bionic Star" + "V1.2" | **"Star Bionic"** + **"v1.2-REVAMPED"** |
| `MainActivity.kt` (about dialog) | "Bionic Star" + `Version ${BuildConfig.VERSION_NAME} (${VERSION_CODE})` | **"Star Bionic"** + **"v1.2-REVAMPED"** |
| `ui/AppDrawer.kt` (main app drawer header) | "Bionic Star" | **"Star Bionic"** |
| `ui/XServerDrawer.kt` (in-game drawer header) | "Bionic Star" | **"Star Bionic"** |

`build.gradle` `versionName` and `versionCode` intentionally **unchanged** so CI tag/APK naming convention continues working (`v7.1.4x-cmod-<date>-<sha>`).

## Compose Migration Report Sync + Part G (2026-05-06) — ON BETA-4 ✅

**Branches:**
- star-compose: `docs/migration-report-refresh` → merged into `beta-4` (`6c1329c`); then `docs/sync-with-nightlies-add-part-g` → merged into `beta-4` (`29b243e`)
- Nightlies: `docs/add-part-g-post-2026-04-22` → merged into `main` (`e688ef7`)

### What was wrong
The in-repo `COMPOSE_MIGRATION_REPORT.md` in star-compose was last updated 2026-04-17 at Part D. Past Claude sessions added Parts E (2026-04-20) and F (2026-04-22) directly to the canonical public copy in `The412Banner/Nightlies/main/COMPOSE_MIGRATION_REPORT.md` without syncing back to star-compose. The two had drifted by ~400 lines. My initial refresh attempt added a "Part E" section that name-collided with Nightlies' existing Part E and partly duplicated Part F4's content.

### What was done
1. Replaced star-compose's report with the Nightlies canonical content as the new base (catches up Parts E + F).
2. Dropped the wrongly-named "Part E" interim refresh.
3. Wrote a new **Part G** covering 2026-04-23 → 2026-05-06 work — applied identically to both repos:
   - G1. SDL2 controller fix (with portable lesson for fork developers)
   - G2. Box64 dropdown read/seed bug + reusable fix template
   - G3. UI branding pass
   - G4. Dead Java/XML cleanup status (5 safe to delete + 1 blocked on LogView fix + 4 contentdialog statics)
   - G5. New gotchas G26 (SoName symlinks during install migration) + G27 (ViewModel reset helpers need init-time override)
   - G6. Updated stats — 27 total documented gotchas
   - G7. Refreshed "Still Active — Needs Migration" roadmap

Both copies now identical at 2,476 lines. Memory entry saved (`feedback_compose_migration_doc_canonical.md`) so future sessions know Nightlies is the canonical home.

### Bonus: UI_MIGRATION_REPORT.md committed
The previously-untracked `UI_MIGRATION_REPORT.md` (originally generated 2026-04-22) was edited with current 2026-05-06 status markers and committed to `beta-4` for the first time.

## Beta-4 Integration Branch — Current State (2026-05-06)

After today's session, `beta-4` is at `6e89bd7` and contains 3 verified items + 2 doc passes:

| # | Merge | Verified | What |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `fce8cf0` | ✅ | Box64 dropdown stale-display fix |
| 2 | `6c1329c` | n/a (docs) | Migration report refresh (initial Part E attempt — superseded) |
| 3 | `29b243e` | n/a (docs) | Sync with Nightlies canonical + Part G |
| 4 | `6e89bd7` | ✅ | Branding/version rename ("Star Bionic" + "v1.2-REVAMPED") |

Workflow established this session: features land on their own branch off `beta-4`, get tested and approved by user, then merge into `beta-4`. When user and developers happy, merge `beta-4` → `main` and trigger Manual Release Build for Beta 4. Memory entry: `feedback_star_compose_beta_branch_workflow.md`.
